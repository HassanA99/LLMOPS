# Fula Text-to-Speech and Dialect Prediction

This project aims to develop a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for the Fula language and a dialect prediction model. It utilizes the Coqui TTS framework and custom modules for data processing and model training.

## Project Structure

- `train.py`: Main script for training the TTS model
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the TTS model and dataset
- `data_loader.py`: Functions for loading and processing the Fula dataset
- `model.py`: TTS model initialization and related functions
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for logging, file management, etc.
- `dialect_predict.py`: Script for training and evaluating the dialect prediction model

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TTS
- transformers
- datasets
- scikit-learn
